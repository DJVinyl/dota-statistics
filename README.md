# Getting Started

Built using ReactJS and D3.

Using the D3 library and OpenDota API, we will visualize the data that is in the OpenDota.
Currently using a JSON downloaded from OpenDota API on Saturday May 8th. Did this to avoid repeated GET requests to OpenDataAPI. As well the prupose of this application is practice with D3, not Axio's requesting and caching of data.

Get started by running ```npm install```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
